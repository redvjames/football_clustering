Football (also known as soccer) has been going through a remarkable evolution in the past years, characterized by various factors that have significantly impacted its pace, tactics, and overall gameplay. This evolution has been driven by advancements in technology, changes in player conditioning and training methods, tactical innovations, and shifts in the rules and regulations governing the sport. As the sport is being redefined over time, so should the way coaches and managers think about the roles of players.

In this project we wish to redefine the positions and examine their potential future directions using clustering techniques and outlier analysis. In our analysis we found that cluster outliers in general are imporved versions of inliers. In the professional level of football, improvement of physical capabilities start to give diminishing returns. Defenders and goalkeepers are have normalized ratings which means that either the outliers are a mix of high rated and low rated players, or that it takes only a small increase in attributes of defenders and goalkeepers to be an outlier. Lastly, midfielders and forwards should be encouraged to try to make more plays to show off their offensive ratings.

There are a few key assumptions made in this project which includes the parsimoniousness of clusters in our dataset without actually knowing the position distribution of players in our dataset. And as a recommendation, it would be intereseting to perform further analysis on the cluster outliers to see whether their improved stats translate to winning games in football leagues.




Data Source
This dataset contains detailed data related to the FIFA World Cup, including information on players' overall ratings, as well as their individual ratings for specific skillsets. The dataset contains the player attribute information. This part of the database is sourced from the FIFA video game series, which is the best representation of the players' ability in the sport of soccer. This data can be used to investigate a variety of different aspects related to the World Cup and its players, including anomaly detection for player ratings. This dataset is definitely worth taking a look at for those fans of international football, or just interested in studying some of the best athletes in the world.
